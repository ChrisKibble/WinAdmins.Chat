# WinAdmins Chat

## Who are the WinAdmins?

The WinAdmins are a society of engineers interested in discussion, community, and peer support. We do not represent any one specific organization or country. While we started as a primary Microsoft Windows-focused support group (inspiring the name WinAdmins), over the last several years our discussions have branched to include Mac, cloud, and general networking.

## Wait, weren't you on Slack?

Although we were a Slack community for quite a long time, in late 2019 we realized that our needs outgrew what Slack was able to provide for free. As we're not corporately sponsored, and attempts to get a discounted rate failed, we moved to the Discord platform.  This decision was not taken lightly and was made after several months of testing six different popular platforms.
