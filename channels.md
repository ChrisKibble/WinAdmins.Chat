# WinAdmins Channels

Channels in Discord, like many other platforms dating at least as far back as IRC, are individual chat rooms where specific topics are discussed.  Channels can be public (everyone is a member), private (hidden until some action is taken), or secret (e.g. a channel for admins or moderators).
